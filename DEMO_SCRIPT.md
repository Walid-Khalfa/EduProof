## 💡 Jury Q&A Preparation

### Expected Questions

**Q: How do you prevent fake institutions from issuing certificates?**
**A**: We have an institution verification system. Only approved institutions (verified via admin panel) can issue certificates. We verify institutions through official documentation and domain verification.

**Q: What if a certificate needs to be revoked (e.g., degree fraud)?**
**A**: Institutions can revoke certificates through the admin panel. The NFT remains on-chain (immutable), but we mark it as revoked in our registry contract. Verification checks this status.

**Q: How much does it cost per certificate?**
**A**: On Sepolia testnet, it's free (test ETH). On mainnet, gas fees are ~$0.50-$2 per certificate depending on network congestion. We're exploring Layer 2 solutions (Polygon, Arbitrum) to reduce costs to <$0.01.

**Q: Can students transfer their certificates?**
**A**: Yes! Certificates are NFTs, so students own them in their wallet. They can transfer ownership if needed (e.g., name change, wallet migration). The blockchain record remains immutable.

**Q: What about privacy? Not everyone wants their degree public.**
**A**: Great question! We're implementing zero-knowledge proofs for privacy-preserving verification. Students can prove they have a degree without revealing all details. Currently, students control who they share their token ID with.

**Q: How accurate is the OCR?**
**A**: Google Gemini achieves 90%+ accuracy on standard certificates. We have human-in-the-loop validation where users review and edit extracted data before minting. We also have fallback models for reliability.

**Q: What's your business model?**
**A**: We charge institutions a small fee per certificate ($1-5) which covers blockchain costs and platform maintenance. Students verify for free. We also offer premium features like bulk issuance APIs and custom branding.

**Q: How do you handle different certificate formats globally?**
**A**: Our AI is trained on diverse certificate formats. We support PDFs and images in any language. The OCR adapts to different layouts. For institutions with unique formats, we can fine-tune the model.

**Q: What's next for EduProof?**
**A**: 
1. Pilot with 2-3 universities
2. Layer 2 deployment for lower costs
3. Mobile app for students
4. Integration with LinkedIn and job platforms
5. Expand to professional certifications (AWS, Google, etc.)

**Q: Why blockchain instead of a traditional database?**
**A**: 
- **Immutability**: Records can't be altered or deleted
- **Transparency**: Anyone can verify without trusting us
- **Decentralization**: No single point of failure
- **Student Ownership**: Credentials belong to students, not institutions
- **Global Standard**: Works across borders without intermediaries
