# Post-Mint UX Polish

## Overview

This document describes the post-mint UX improvements implemented to enhance the certificate minting flow, including automatic reset, reliable PDF preview rendering, share actions, and double-mint prevention.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. Reset Mint Flow After Success ✅

**Goal:** Clear all form state and reset the UI after a successful mint.

**Implementation:**
- Added `handleProofPanelClose()` in `Index.tsx` that triggers `resetFlow()` when the success modal is closed
- `resetFlow()` (in `useMintFlowStore.ts`) clears:
  - All form fields (student, course, institution, date)
  - File upload and preview URLs
  - OCR results and verification scores
  - All step statuses (reset to `idle`)
  - PDF metadata (pages, preview CID)
  - Preserves wallet connection and network status
- File input key is regenerated to force DOM reset
- Mint button is disabled until new file is uploaded and validated

**Acceptance:**
- Upload → OCR → Mint → Success → Close modal → Form is blank
- Stepper resets to step 1 (OCR)
- All pre-flight checks reset except wallet/network
- No stale "Ready to mint" state

---

### 2. Always Use Proxy for PDF Previews ✅

**Goal:** Ensure PDF SVG previews always use the backend proxy with correct `Content-Type: image/svg+xml` headers.

**Implementation:**
- Created `src/utils/share.ts` with `buildProxyPreviewUrl(cid)` helper
- Proxy URL format: `${API_URL}/api/ipfs/preview/${cid}.svg?t=${cacheBust}`
- Cache-busting: `${cid.slice(-6)}-${Date.now() % 100000}`
- Updated `ProofPanel.tsx`:
  - Uses proxy URL for PDFs via `buildProxyPreviewUrl()`
  - Performs HEAD check via `checkProxyPreview()` before rendering
  - Shows loading spinner while checking
  - Falls back to error UI with "Open in new tab" link if HEAD fails
  - Uses `<img decoding="async" loading="lazy">` for optimal rendering
- `UploadArea.tsx` already uses proxy (from previous implementation)

**Acceptance:**
- Upload PDF → preview visible in form (proxy URL)
- Mint → Success modal shows same preview (proxy URL, not blob:)
- Network panel shows `/api/ipfs/preview/:cid.svg?t=...` requests
- Response headers include `Content-Type: image/svg+xml`
- No raw IPFS gateway URLs for PDFs

---

### 3. Share Proof Quick Actions ✅

**Goal:** Provide easy sharing options in the success modal.

**Implementation:**
- Added three share action buttons in `ProofPanel.tsx`:

  **Copy Proof Links:**
  - Copies markdown block with IPFS image, metadata, and Etherscan TX URLs
  - Uses `buildProofMarkdown()` from `share.ts`
  - Shows success toast on copy

  **Copy JSON Metadata:**
  - Fetches metadata JSON from IPFS gateway
  - Pretty-prints with `JSON.stringify(json, null, 2)`
  - Uses `fetchMetadataJSON()` from `share.ts`
  - Shows success toast on copy

  **Open All Links:**
  - Opens 3 tabs: image preview, metadata JSON, Etherscan TX
  - Uses `openAllLinks()` from `share.ts`
  - Handles popup blocker gracefully with toast feedback

**Acceptance:**
- Click "Copy Proof Links" → markdown copied to clipboard
- Click "Copy JSON Metadata" → pretty JSON copied
- Click "Open All Links" → 3 tabs open (or toast if blocked)
- All actions show non-blocking success/error toasts

---

### 4. Prevent Accidental Double-Mint ✅

**Goal:** Ensure users cannot trigger multiple mints with rapid clicks.

**Implementation:**
- Added `isMintingInProgress` state in `Index.tsx`
- Set to `true` immediately when `handleMint()` is called
- Early return if already minting (logged to console)
- Reset to `false` on:
  - Successful mint completion
  - Any error during IPFS upload or blockchain transaction
- Mint button disabled when `isMintingInProgress === true`
- Added idempotency key to backend indexing request:
  - Generated from `keccak256(fileSha256 + owner + timestamp)`
  - Sent as `x-idempotency-key` header
  - Backend can use this to prevent duplicate indexing

**Acceptance:**
- Rapid double-click on "Mint Certificate" → only one request sent
- Button shows spinner and is disabled during minting
- On error, button re-enables and error toast appears
- Console shows warning if duplicate mint attempted

---

### 5. UX Micro-Polish ✅

**Goal:** Improve visual polish and accessibility.

**Implementation:**

**Success Modal (`ProofPanel.tsx`):**
- Title: "Certificate Minted Successfully ✅"
- Subtitle: "Your certificate has been minted as an NFT and indexed. Share the proof below."
- Details grid with improved layout:
  - Student, Course, Institution, Issue Date
  - Light gray background (`bg-slate-50 dark:bg-slate-800/50`)
  - Proper spacing and typography hierarchy
- Preview with loading/error states:
  - Spinner while checking proxy availability
  - Error fallback with "Open in new tab" link
  - `object-contain` for proper aspect ratio
- Share actions panel with clear icons and labels

**Contrast & Accessibility:**
- All text meets WCAG AA contrast requirements
- Light mode: `text-slate-900` on `bg-slate-50`
- Dark mode: `text-white` on `bg-slate-800/50`
- Preview backgrounds: `bg-white dark:bg-slate-900`
- Proper focus states on all interactive elements

**IPFS URL Handling:**
- All `ipfs://` URIs converted to gateway URLs via `ipfsToGateway()`
- Proxy URLs used for PDF previews (not raw gateway)
- Consistent URL formatting across UI

---

## Files Modified

### New Files
- `src/utils/share.ts` - Share utilities (proxy URL builder, markdown generator, JSON fetcher, link opener)

### Modified Files
- `src/components/ProofPanel.tsx` - Added share actions, proxy preview, polished UI
- `src/pages/Index.tsx` - Double-mint prevention, idempotency, reset on modal close
- `src/stores/useMintFlowStore.ts` - (No changes needed, `resetFlow()` already implemented)

---

## Testing Instructions

### Manual Tests

#### 1. PDF Preview in Form
```bash
# Upload a PDF certificate
# Expected: Preview shows in upload area using proxy URL
# Network tab: GET /api/ipfs/preview/:cid.svg?t=... → 200 OK
# Response headers: Content-Type: image/svg+xml
```

#### 2. Complete Mint Flow
```bash
# 1. Upload PDF → OCR extracts fields
# 2. Confirm fields → Click "Mint Certificate"
# 3. Approve MetaMask transaction
# 4. Wait for confirmation
# Expected: Success modal appears with preview, details, and share actions
```

#### 3. Share Actions
```bash
# In success modal:
# - Click "Copy Proof Links" → paste to notepad → verify markdown format
# - Click "Copy JSON Metadata" → paste to notepad → verify valid JSON
# - Click "Open All Links" → verify 3 tabs open (or toast if blocked)
```

#### 4. Reset Flow
```bash
# After successful mint:
# - Click X to close success modal
# Expected:
#   - Form fields cleared
#   - File upload area reset
#   - Stepper back to step 1 (OCR)
#   - "Mint Certificate" button disabled
#   - No stale data in UI
```

#### 5. Double-Mint Prevention
```bash
# Upload and fill form
# Rapidly double-click "Mint Certificate"
# Expected:
#   - Only one MetaMask popup appears
#   - Console shows: "[Mint] Already minting, ignoring duplicate request"
#   - Button stays disabled during minting
```

#### 6. Light/Dark Theme
```bash
# Toggle theme switcher
# Expected:
#   - Preview backgrounds remain readable (white/dark gray)
#   - Text contrast meets WCAG AA
#   - Share action buttons have proper hover states
#   - Success modal maintains visual hierarchy
```

### Automated Tests (Future)

```typescript
// Suggested test cases:
describe('Post-Mint UX', () => {
  it('should reset flow when success modal is closed', () => {});
  it('should use proxy URL for PDF previews', () => {});
  it('should copy proof links to clipboard', () => {});
  it('should prevent double-mint with rapid clicks', () => {});
  it('should show loading state during proxy check', () => {});
});
```

## Known Limitations

1. **Popup Blockers:** "Open All Links" may be blocked by browser popup blockers. Users will see a toast notification.

2. **IPFS Gateway Latency:** Metadata JSON fetch may be slow if IPFS gateway is under load. No retry logic implemented yet.

3. **Idempotency Backend:** Backend must implement idempotency key handling to prevent duplicate indexing. Currently only sent as header.

4. **Mobile UX:** Share actions not optimized for mobile (no native share sheet integration).

---

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] Add native mobile share sheet integration
- [ ] Implement retry logic for metadata JSON fetch
- [ ] Add QR code generation for proof links
- [ ] Support batch certificate minting
- [ ] Add "Download Certificate" button (PDF/PNG export)
- [ ] Implement backend idempotency key validation
- [ ] Add analytics tracking for share actions

---

## Rollback Instructions

If issues arise, revert these commits:
1. `src/utils/share.ts` - Delete file
2. `src/components/ProofPanel.tsx` - Revert to previous version
3. `src/pages/Index.tsx` - Remove `isMintingInProgress`, `handleProofPanelClose`, idempotency key
