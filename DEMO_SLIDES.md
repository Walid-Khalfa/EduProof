## Appendix: FAQ Slides

### FAQ 1: Institution Verification

**Q: How do you verify institutions?**

**A: Multi-Step Process**
1. Official documentation review
2. Domain verification (edu emails)
3. Manual approval by admin
4. Ongoing monitoring

**Registry Contract**
- On-chain institution list
- Only approved can mint
- Revocation capability

---

### FAQ 2: Cost Breakdown

**Q: Why is it so cheap?**

**A: Efficient Architecture**

| Component | Cost |
|-----------|------|
| Gas fees (Sepolia) | $0.50 |
| IPFS storage | $0.10 |
| AI OCR | $0.05 |
| Infrastructure | $0.10 |
| **Total** | **$0.75** |

**Pricing**: $1-5 (30-85% margin)

**Layer 2**: <$0.01 gas fees

---

### FAQ 3: Privacy

**Q: What about student privacy?**

**A: Multiple Layers**

**Current**
- Students control token ID sharing
- No PII on public blockchain
- IPFS content-addressed (not indexed)

**Future (ZK Proofs)**
- Prove degree without revealing details
- Selective disclosure
- Privacy-preserving verification

**Example**: Prove "I have a CS degree from MIT" without revealing name, date, or GPA.

---

### FAQ 4: Scalability

**Q: Can this scale to millions of certificates?**

**A: Yes - Multi-Chain Strategy**

**Current (Sepolia)**
- 15 TPS (transactions per second)
- ~1M certs/day theoretical

**Layer 2 (Polygon, Arbitrum)**
- 1000+ TPS
- 100M+ certs/day
- <$0.01 per cert

**Batch Minting**
- Issue 100s of certs in one transaction
- Further cost reduction

---

### FAQ 5: Revocation

**Q: What if a degree is revoked?**

**A: Flexible Revocation System**

**On-Chain Registry**
```solidity
mapping(uint256 => bool) public revoked;
```

**Process**
1. Institution calls `revoke(tokenId)`
2. NFT remains (immutable)
3. Verification checks revocation status
4. UI shows "REVOKED" badge

**Use Cases**
- Degree fraud discovered
- Academic misconduct
- Administrative errors

---

### FAQ 6: International Support

**Q: Does it work globally?**

**A: Yes - Designed for Global Use**

**Multi-Language**
